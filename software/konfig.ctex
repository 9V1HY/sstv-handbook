\chapter{Computer operations}

In one afternoon, an equipped hamradio operator can begin receiving SSTV.
All that is needed is to make a connection cable between a transceiver and a
sound card and download some SSTV related software. Then tune into 14.230\,MHz
USB for 24 hour-a-day SSTV activity.

Programs for SSTV operations are very similar and provide equivalent basic
functions, of course with different comfort levels. Some of them are intuitive and
well-arranged, while others require studying a manual. Everybody has the possibility to
choose from more variants and see what is best for him and what provides
requested functions. Every operator must know these basic functions:

\startitemize
\item to configure an accurate sampling frequency for reception and transmission,
\item to set proper sound card volume levels,
\item to use the tuning indicator,
\item to manually change the transmission mode,
\item to load and save images in common graphic formats,
\item to create an image gallery for transmission and
\item to add text into transmitted images.
\stopitemize

\section{Hardware configuration}

Take your time in selecting a suitable configuration of
the computer in your hamshack. The unpleasant fact is that,
operating system and software requirements  are constantly on the rise.
For SSTV operations it is possible to use obsolete
PCs with old 386 processors. The {\em Hamcomm} modem and some other
popular programs from the nineties run on DOS. In this case,
4\,MB of RAM, a hundred megabytes hard disk and SVGA
graphics card with 256 colors are enough. But graphic cards with 32 or 64 thousand colors are more suitable.

To use a sound card a good PC is needed. At the least it
should be configured with 150MHz Pentium, 64\,MB
RAM and few gigabytes hard disk. A graphics card
needs to support 1024$\times$768 resolution in 
64 thousands or 16.7 million color mode. The minimal operating
system is Windows\,95 OSR\,2, but some new programs may not
run in Win95. I recommend having better hardware but you don't
need the latest mega-hyper model. 

There are also software products for Mac\,OS\,X and for GNU/Linux, but
the largest selection is for Microsoft Windows.

\section{Sound card as a modem}

A sound card is standard PC equipment these days. It can be used as a music
player, for multimedia, games and recording. The main application of a sound card
in hamshacks is as a MODEM. The modem~-- MOdulator/DEModulator allows computer
information to be transmitted and received over physical media like radio
waves or telephone lines. The modem translates analog signals to digital data
and vice versa.

\subsection{Sound processing in PCs}

To allow the computer to work with sound signals, the signal must be converted 
into a format suitable for data processing (digital or discrete signal).

\subsubsection[sampling]{Sampling}

The digital conversion process begins with {\em sampling}. Sampling
is an activity which periodically scans the current value of the analog
signal.  For example, this happens 11,025 times per second or
depends on a user defined sample rate supported  by the sound card. 
The sampling frequency of sound cards ranges from
8\,kHz suitable for internet telephony up to 96\,kHz designated
for more exacting requirements of recording studios.

\placefigure[][none]{The conversion of an analog signal into numeric data.}
{\externalfigure[software/obr/ac_prevod.pdf]}

The answer to the question of what sampling frequency should be used gives us
Shannon's theorem (also knows as Nyquist-KotÄ›lnik-Shannon theorem). It defines
that a signal continuous in time, containing spectral components with the
highest frequency $f_{max}$, can be clearly reconstructed from a sequence
of evenly spaced samples with a sampling frequency $f_s$ greater than double
$f_{max}$:

\startformula
f_{s} > 2f_{max}
\stopformula

You can see the importance of Shannon's theorem in the 
example below. The signal in \in{figure}[pic:sampled]a expresses the
dependency between time $t$ and amplitude $A$.  Using Fourier's analysis, we can find 
(see \in{chapter}[bandwidth]), that the signal contains two harmonic components, showed
in~\in[pic:sampled]b.

\placefigure[][pic:sampled]{Example of signal.}
\startcombination[2*1]
		{\externalfigure[software/obr/signal-A.pdf]}{a) Surveyed signal}
		{\externalfigure[software/obr/signal-B.pdf]}{b) Spectral components}
\stopcombination

By using Fourier's transformation, the signal can also be expressed as a
dependency between amplitude $A$ and frequency $f$~-- {\em signal spectrum}.
Both frequency components are evident $f_1$ and $f_2=f_{max}$ in the
signal in \in{fig.}[pic:spectrum].

\placefigure[][pic:spectrum]{The frequency spectrum of signal in \in{fig.}[pic:sampled]a}
{\externalfigure[software/obr/spektrum.pdf]}

For explicit signal reconstruction the condition $f_{s} > 2f_{max}$ must be
satisfied, see fig.~\in[pic:sampleok]. If a sampling frequency is
lower then $2f_{max}$ then  the higher frequency components are lost. This
error is called {\em aliasing}.

\placefigure[][pic:sampleok]{The signal sampled with a frequency higher than $2f_{max}$}
{\externalfigure[software/obr/signal-VZ.pdf]}

\placefigure[][pic:samplebad]{The sample rate does not meet the Shannon's theorem.}
{\externalfigure[software/obr/signal-VZbad.pdf]}

For the sampling of common narrow band signals like SSTV, RTTY, PSK31 or WEFAX,
which are transferred via SSB channel with a bandwidth of about 2\,500---3\,000\,Hz;
a sample rate of 11,025\,Hz is enough.

\subsection{Analog-to-digital conversion}

The next way of an analog signal continues to the analog-to-digital (A/D) converter.
The current value of signal converted into digital data in this device. Some A/D
converters works with a resolution 8 or 16 bits according to type or settings
of a sound card. The resolution of A/D converter indicates the accuracy of
signal amplitude scan in a defined range, for 8 bits it is $2^8=256$ values and
for 16 it is 65,536. 

Constrained resolution of A/D converter causes an {\em quantization} error. E.g.
for 8 bit converter processing voltage range 0--5.0\,V it's the error
$5.0/(2^8-1) \doteq 0.02$\,V. The 8bit converter cannon distinguish
voltage levels lower then 0.02\,V. So for input voltage 3.111\,V it could
find corresponding numeric value $10011110_2\,\approx 3.098$\,V
or $10011111_2\,\approx 3.118$\,V because less significant bit is 
influenced by quantization error. The size of the error can be
decreased by greater resolution of A/D converter. For our purposes
the 16bit resolution is acceptable.

A modern sound cards could be equipped with digital signal processor (DSP),
which extend card functions e.g. for filtering or data compression during
recording so it can lighten load of main computer CPU. E.g. {\em Sound Blaster
Live!} contains programmable DSP labeled {\em EMU10K1}.

The choice of sound card type depends only on user's preferences and his
intends of use. Many PCs has integrated sound card directly on a motherboard.

\subsection{Interface between TRX and PC}

The basic interface is made of shielded cables and 3.5mm jack plugs. A
reception cable connects sound card input {\em Line In} and TRX headphones
output or output for external speaker. For use of sound card microphone input
can be used TRX output often labeled as {\ss AF OUT} with impedance about
10\,k$\Omega$ which gives max. output voltage 100\,mV. This output could be also
used for interfacing tape deck or audio amplifier. Microphone input of sound
card has automatic gain controller (AGC) for better recording and it is
possible connect dynamics microphones with impedance from 600 to
10.000\,$\Omega$.

\placefigure[][none]{Basic interface between transceiver and sound card.}
{\externalfigure[software/obr/sound_card.pdf][width=0.6\makeupwidth]}

For the transmission it is possible to use {\em Line Out} with impedance
about  600\,$\Omega$. The {\em Line Out} can be connected to microphone
input of TRX or a rear panel connector like {\ss PATCH IN}.

Some transceivers has a feature that microphone input and rear panel input
are interconnected so it is necessary disconnect the microphone during
AFSK transmission, because noise in hamshack could interfere with
sound card signal! Check your TRX instruction manual for particular
interfacing.

Last thing you need to set up is audio levels of received and transmitted
signal. It can be made using operating system tools. The level of
transmitted signal should be about 2/3 of max. level. The signal
could not be too attenuated or over-excited and distorted. You can detect
it by monitor of outgoing signals. For receiving signal you can set
proper level directly on TRX and check the input level in your SSTV software.

	\placefigure[][none]{Software volume control.}
	{\externalfigure[software/obr/hlas.png][width=.8\makeupwidth]}

After the audio mixer configuration it is useful to save your
sound card settings (you can restore it every time before operations).
A program {\em QuickMix} is can easily store your settings, because
some other program can change it.

\subsection{PTT control}

The PTT (Push-To-Talk) button switch between reception and transmission. For
its control there are several possibilities:

\startitemize[n]
\item Manual PTT switching. This handy method is not very elegant, but for the 
first experiments can be used.

\item Automatic switching can provide TRX with a VOX feature, when the
TRX is automatically keyed by signal in the input. An disadvantage of this
method may be that its reaction is not immediate, so in case of digital modes
the beginning states of transmission or SSTV vertical synchronization can be
lost. Keep in ming that operating system often produce malicious sounds that could
accidentally key the transmitter.

\item Automatic PTT switch can control a computer. All SSTV programs support
PTT control over a simple serial port (COM, RS-232) circuit. The circuit contains
one switching transistor or opto-isolator and few passive parts. See
\in{schematic}[pic:trafo] for details. The control signal is connected to {\tt RTS}
pin (7 at Cannon DB9 connector, 4 at DB25) or {\tt DTR} (4 at DB9, 20 at DB25), selected pin can
be changed by software configuration. The ground is on serial port wired on pin
5 at DB9 or 7 at DB25.

The big amount of handheld TRXs has a similar pin for microphone input and PTT.
In this case an audio signal should be galvanicaly separated by capacitor about
100\,nF and PTT signal is connected by resistor which resistance can by find in
TRX instruction or you can connect trimming resistor about 15\,k$\Omega$ and
test the max. value when TRX switching.

\item Some transceivers support control over serial port. This CAT (Computer
Aided Transceiver) interface can provide PTT switching. Over CAT interface can
be send commands e.g. for tuning, mode control, etc. This method must be
supported by software, for example MixW can control some TRXes so it is not needed
to practically touch the TRX buttons.
\stopitemize

What to do if your computer is not equipped with serial port? Some motherboard manufacturers 
build only one serial port and notebook manufacturers doesn't provide any serial port.
If this happens you can use VOX or obtain USB/RS232 interface. Some programs also support
similar switching circuit as described before but on parallel port (LPT).

\subsection{Eliminate supply noise}

A computer and a TRX can have slightly different electrical potential and in
this case the direct connection causes annoying noise in communication channel.
It is possible to remove noise witch galvanic separation of both devices. The
path of audio signal should go throught galvanic transformer and PTT control
switch with opto-isolator, e.g. 4N25, 4N33, etc. Maybe you will need to change
{\ss R2} to lower value when the opto-isolator is not switched properly when
serial port signal is on.

\section[slant]{Timing oscillator configuration}

There is description of synchronous (free-run) SSTV system in
\in{section}[horsync]. Horizontal synchronization pulses (syncs) are detected
only at the beginning of reception and after synchronization a reception device stops
detect syncs and receive with free-run scan. Due to this there are excessive
requirements for accurate timing of corresponding stations.

If the timing slightly differs then images are distorted~-- inaccurate timing
causes image {\em slant}. You can see image slant for 0.01\,\% timing difference
in \in{fig.}[pic:slant]. If a transmitting station has higher timing (and reception
lower) the image slants to the right (\in[pic:slant]a) in opposite situation to the left
(\in[pic:slant]b).

\placefigure[][pic:slant]{Image slant distortion when inaccurate timing is used for
free-run modes.}
\startcombination[2*1]
	{\externalfigure[software/obr/slant1.png][width=5cm]}{a) Opposite station has higher timing}
	{\externalfigure[software/obr/slant2.png][width=5cm]}{b) Opposite staion has lower timing}
\stopcombination
	
However timing derived from sample rate is not used to be exactly
11,025.00\,Hz, but often can differ up to few tenths of percent for each peace
of hardware. For speech and music processing it doesn't matter, but in free-run
transmission of SSTV it causes problems.

\warning{
The configuration of accurate timing/sample rate for reception and transmission 
apart must be done to meet the strict requirements for synchronous SSTV broadcast.
Your signal must be acceptable for any SSTV device.
}

All SSTV program are equipped with a tool for the timing configuration. 

It is possible to receive SSTV signal from a band and by an edge of received
image set the timing~-- program will automatically compute timing deviation.
This way has a disadvantage, because not all SSTV stations has proper transmit
timing. This is caused by offset between receiving and transmitting timing.

Much more precise way is use of shortwave broadcast of timing normal. Programs
are equipped with special reception option, which displays spectrum in a second
cycles. For timing setting just tune to the frequency of broadcast and leave to
plot received pulses for several minutes.

The usable transmitter is a Moscow station {\ss RWM} operating on frequencies
4,996.0, 9,996.0, 14,996.0\,kHz with 8\,kilowatts power. So it can be nicely
received in Europe/Asia region. Select CW mode and tune your receiver directly
to one of station frequencies. The unmodulated carrier is transmitted between
0. and 8. minute of an hour, telegraphy identification goes from 9. minute and
then the timing signal will continue. Pulses in intervals 1/60 and 1\,Hz goes
between 10. and 20. minute and 10Hz pulses goes between 20. and 30. minute.
This is repeated every 30 minutes. 

\placefigure[][none]{The configuration of accurate timing with {\ss RMW} reception
	 in MMSSTV.}
{\externalfigure[software/obr/rmw_nastaveni.png][width=.75\makeupwidth]}

The reception of {\ss WWV} station is the next possibility. This station
broadcast timing pulses and announcement on frequencies 2,500.0, 5,000.0,
10,000.0, 15,000.0, 20,000.0\,kHz and uses double sideband (DSB) modulation.
You can receive it with AM mode selected. The {\ss WWV} operates from the North
America, Fort Collins in Colorado. The used power ranges from 2.5  to 10\,kW.

There is yet another way with WEFAX station reception, because these stations
must have accurate timing too due to synchronous transfer.

The deviance error you should measure use to be expressed like absolute value
of actual frequency, e.g. $f=11024{,}45$\,Hz or like deviance from $f_s$ the
$\Delta_f=-0{,}55$\,Hz. Some program this measure in {\em parts per million
(ppm)} unit. The ppm deviance can be computed:

$$\Delta = \frac{\Delta_f}{f_s}\cdot10^6.$$

For the $f=11024{,}45$\,Hz the deviance in ppm is:

 $$\Delta =
 \frac{\Delta_f}{f_s}\cdot10^6=\frac{-0{,}55}{11025{,}00}\cdot10^6\,\rm{ppm}\doteq-50\,\rm{ppm}.$$ 

\subsection{Transmit timing offset}

There is necessity to configure transmit timing {\em TX offset} after the
precise configuration of reception sample rate, when received SSTV images are
not slanted. It is important for your own transmission, because inaccurate
transmit timing causes image slant on reception side. 

Some programs makes possible to monitor outgoing SSTV signals, so with this
feedback it is practicable to check the TX offset~-- deviance between reception
and transmission sample rate. The feedback can be internal or external. {\em
Extenal feedback} needs to connect Line Out and Line In with cable and it
requires a sound card with full-duplex mode enabled. By this way you can set {\em
TX offset} precisely on your own.

The {\em internal feedback} doing almost the same, but no external cables
is needed. But some sound cards support only software feedback, so you will
find zero deviance, but it is not real fact! Then the TX offset setting must be
done with external feedback or with opposite station help. You need to disable
any automatic corrections of received signals in this way.

Anyway you need to make \uv{dry run} QSO before your first CQ. This helps you
to uncover possible problems with TX offset, supply noise, audio level, etc.

The TX offset issue is often pretty messy. You can notice that some software
running concurrent with your SSTV program can influence sound cart output and
then the change of sample rate occurs. Even the simple Volume Control tool can do
this. So it is useful to stop unnecessary program running in the background.
Especially programs that can influence sound card output or decreases stability
of Microsoft Windows.

You may notice a strange behaviour if you are user of modern sound card with
full duplex mode enabled with several output channels with a support of
different sample rates for each channel. This is for example {\em SB Live!
Value}. I have noticed that my TX offset randomly changes! I have this
experiences with SB Live! Value and I found that another radio amateurs has
same. You can try to set other sample rate than 11,025.0\,Hz in this case, if
this doesn't load your computer too much. For example try 48,000.0\,Hz, this
value is fixed sample rate (see your card user's guide) and best results you
can achieve with using of this value or its half or quarter~-- 24,000.0\,kHz or
12,000.0\,kHz. When you change this value you need to recalibrate your accurate
timing again.

To avoid these problems you can constantly monitor the outgoing signal through
the external feedback with the TRX monitor enabled and before your today first
transmission you will check that everything is fine. It's unpleasant that
problems often occurs during QSO and then you will stunned by counterpart
replay images. 

\section{SSTV tuning}

First of all, we need to find SSTV stations by listening near calling frequencies.
Thanks to typical SSTV sound and clattering of syncs it is not a problem to distinguish
between SSTV and other communication modes.

Every SSTV program is equipped with precise tuning indicators~-- spectroscopes,
see fig.~\in[pic:tuning]. The spectroscope shows frequency band from 1000\,Hz
to 2500\,Hz with marks for critical frequncies~-- 1200\,Hz for syncs, 1500\,Hz
and 2300\,Hz for the video signal.

Is is possible to simple detect band of video signal and syncs during
clear reception. Rotate the tuning knob to achieve that all important frequencies
are aligned in spectroscope display.

\section{Video digitalization}

The video digitizer should be additional equipment of SSTV station. The device
can convert output signal from camera into computer form. There is a great
choice of many different devices with varying capabilities, parameters and
price. You can choose some webcams, frame grabbers, TV cards or digital
cameras. Then your broadcast will not be limited only to pre-prepared images
and you will have a lot more fun with live transmission.

The cheapest option are web cameras, they are equipped with a low-resolution CCD
and low-cost optics, but provided quality is suitable for SSTV.

An another option is a TV card with video input. This possibility is more
expensive because you must connect an external camera where the choices ranges
from cheap CCTV black and white or color CCD cameras up to professional studio
equipment.
