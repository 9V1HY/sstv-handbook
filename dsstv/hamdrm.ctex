\section{HamDRM system}

Communication system {\em HamDRM} is derived from open standard
Digital Radio Mondiale~\cite{etsi_drm}, which was created for
digitalization of radio broadcast on medium-wave and short-wave bands.
Normal DRM use bandwidth 4.5\,kHz to 20\,kHz for sound quality similar
to FM broadcast on VHF. The hamradio version {\em HamDRM} was created
by Francesco Lanza, HB9TLK. It is modified for usage in SSB channel with
2.5\,kHz bandwidth. HamDRM can be used for image and data file
transfer and also for voice communication, so it should be competitor
for analog SSB in future.

The used modulation is {\em COFDM (Coded Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplex)}, which has maximal utilization of communication
channel. The Reed-Solomon code is used for error correction.

The OFDM signal consists of a huge number of subcarriers in baseband.
There are from 29 to 57 subcarriers in case of HamDRM. An each
subcarrier is modulated independently with quadrature amplitude
modulation (QAM) and together with error-correction code creates
COFDM. This modulation is well resistant to phase distortion,
attenuation, selective fading and pulse interference. The used modulation
techniques are described later in \in{section}[qammod].

Unlike RDFT, which needs 3 partial operations~-- coding, recording of
broadcast and decoding, the HamDRM doesn't transmit data in whole block, but
the file is divided into separate segments, so the  image can be 
decoded and displayed  during transmission.

HamDRM can be used in three basic modes. The {\em Mode A} allows 
the fastest transmission, but does not protect against the
negative effects caused by selective fading. The {\em Mode B} is slower 
than the first mode, but is resistant against the negative impacts and
it's much more robust. The last mode is {\em Mode E}, which is designed
for communication through a channel with large delay and Doppler effect.

The QAM modulation is used with 4, 16 or 64 states. Modulation QAM-64
is the fastest but it needs a very good level of signal-noise ratio,
at least 18\,dB. Modulation QAM-4 is slower, but is more resistant to
interference and requires a lower signal-noise ratio, about 5--6\,dB.
Minimum SNR for QAM-16 should be about 8--10\,dB. The selection of
modulation depends on an user and an actual conditions prevailing on
the band. Other HamDRM features that can be set by user are following:

\startitemize

\item {\em Interleaving} is used for change of symbol sequence, it is
a way to arrange data in a non-contiguous way to increase performance.
The long interleave has 2 seconds, it supports better error-correction
but causes longer delay during decoding. The short interleave take
400\,ms.

\item {\em Bandwidth} can be changed to 2.3\,kHz or 2.5\,kHz. A
narrower SSB filter can be used for lower bandwidth, but transfer
speed is little lower.

\item {\em Amount of instances} is value that gives number of 
file repetitions during transmission. If there is more than one
instance then all segments will be repeated and the error parts
can be corrected automatically on reception side during second
or third instance. The number of instances makes transmission time
longer.

\item {\em Leadin} is broadcast at beginning of transmission.
This initialization is used to receiver synchronization, extra
time allows better synchronization and automatic set up
of reception settings.
\stopitemize

Details of the mode and its parameters, along with the call sign is
broadcast throughout the transmission with QAM-4 modulation, so it is
possible to tune to signal during transmission, but the complete data
will be received if at least one complete instance of the transferred
file is received.

Parameter selection of HamDRM modes affects the transmission
performance, and hence the transmission speed, which depends on the
settings, see \in{table}[tab:drmmodes]. The two corresponding stations
should not communicate with each other in the same mode. E.g. station
X has a considerable local interference, so station Y sends in a more
resistant mode, but Y hasn't this problem, so X can easily transmit
in a faster but less resistant mode.

If the transfer of some segments fails completely, it is not lost at all,
because your QSO partner can send {\em bad segment report (BSR)} and you can
resend bad segments again. It's important to send BSR in same mode. The
repeated segments can be received third station too and if have not all
segments received it can complete whole data. When band conditions are really
bad and part of resend fails again, it is possible to generate the new BSR, so
the amount of transfered data will be lower in next resent.

The DRM transfer consist of three channels~-- MSC, SDC and FAC. Each
channel is dedicated for transmission of certain data or service
information and also for each is used different coding and modulation
scheme.

\startdescr{MSC}~-- {\em Main Service Channel} contains data for all services
of DRM multiplex. The multiplex can contain one to four services and
each can transfer data or service information.
\stopdescr

\startdescr{FAC}~-- {\em Fast Access Channel}, is support channel. It uses
QAM-4 and broadcast callsign, DRM mode identification (band spectrum
occupancy, interleaving, mode of MSC and SDC modulation,\ldots).

FAC channel with service information transfer packet with 40 bit size:

\startitemize
\item	2 bit FRAME-ID, identifies a frame in a superframe, value 0, 1, 2
\item	1 bit Spectrum Occupancy (2.3 / 2.5 kHz)
\item	1 bit Interleaver Depth (400\,ms / 2\,s)
\item	1 bit MSC Mode (QAM-16 / QAM-64)
\item	1 bit Protection Level (amount of FEC used)
\item	1 bit Audio/Data
\item	if {\em audio} is used, then follows:
	  \startitemize
	  \item 2 bit, audio codec: LPC, unused, SPEEX;
	  \item 1 bit, text flag;
	  \stopitemize
	\item	if {\em data} is used, then follows:
	  \startitemize
	  \item 2 bity, Packet ID; 
	  \item 1 bit, extended MSC mode (QAM-4);
	  \stopitemize
	\item	21 bits, Label, consisting of $3\times7$ bit ASCII characters (9 characters in superframe)
	\item	1 bit, dummy
	\item	8 bit≈Ø, CRC, used polynomial $G(x)=x^8+x^4+x^3+x^2+1$.
\stopitemize
\stopdescr

\startdescr{SDC}~-- {\em Service Description Channel} contains
information of MSC decoding scheme and broadcast service attributes
during multiplexing.

\subsection{Comparison of HamDRM and RDFT}

There are several software products for RDFT and HamDRM, but
preference of users inclines to HamDRM. Main reason for HamDRM
popularity over RDFT are:

\startitemize
	\item it is possible to decode and display image during transmission;
	\item transfer speed is better up to 3$\times$;
	\item HamDRM continuously broadcasts station identification, so
	receiving operator can start reception and direct yagi;
	\item thanks to several instances, it isn't necessary to record the transmission from beginning to end;	
	\item when reception failed, only bad segments can be repeated, not
whole transmission;
	\item main disadvantage of HamDRM is, that the powerful PC configuration
and OS better then Windows 2000 is a must.
\stopitemize
